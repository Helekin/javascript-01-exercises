## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the Udemy course "JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2023 (Beginner + Advanced)" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The course was last updated in December 2023, and the exercises included here aim to reinforce key concepts of modern JavaScript (ES6+), including fundamental principles, advanced concepts, and best practices.

Topics covered include DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), object-oriented and functional programming, modules, event handling, and modern development tools. Each exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience in JavaScript development, ensuring a strong foundation for both front-end and back-end applications.
